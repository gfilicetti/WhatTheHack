# Challenge 2 â€“ Create a Unit Test in Azure DevOps

[< Previous Challenge](./01-TimeSeriesForecasting.md) - **[Home](./README.md)** - [Next Challenge >](./03-BuildPipeline.md)

## Solution

1.  Make sure you have created a new project in Azure DevOps, created new service connections and have Azure ML workspace configured for the project using config.json file.

2.  Write a Python snippet to validate that AdventureWorks data is indeed downloaded and extracted into `Data/` folder. Do a preview of file count in the data folder. Additionally, you could also pick a csv file visualize the data.
    - **HINT:** It is encouraged to leverage the Python Script task using the pipeline task manager in Azure DevOps
